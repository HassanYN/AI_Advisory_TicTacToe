# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Pygame for the graphical interface and a custom-built AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
## Explanation
- Using minimax algorithm to implement an opponenet that always choose the optimal decision
- AI Logic:  
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The minimax function calls maxValue or minValue depending on the current player to determine the best
possible move. The maxValue and minValue functions recursively evaluate all possible moves and their outcomes to find the optimal move.
## Acknowledgments
- Runner.py was implemented by COE course instructors at KFUPM
- The minimax algorithm concept from artificial intelligence textbooks and online resources, specially from [CS50.ai](https://cs50.ai/)
